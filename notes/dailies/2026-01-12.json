            "title": "Transport-Agnostic Message Semantics",
            "description": "FileTalk defines the shape and meaning of messages independently of how those messages are transported. A message’s structure and interpretation do not depend on whether it is conveyed via filesystem operations, in-memory queues, inter-process mechanisms, or other delivery substrates. Transport is treated as an external concern, allowing the same components to operate unchanged across different execution environments."

            "title": "Opaque Routing Channels",
            "description": "Channels in FileTalk are opaque routing identifiers, not semantic labels or topics. Components emit messages onto channels without interpreting their meaning or destination. Routing logic, including channel remapping or fan-out, is performed entirely by external mechanisms. This separation prevents components from entangling business logic with delivery topology."

          "transparent_remapping": {
            "title": "Transparent Remapping of Components",
            "description": "FileTalk components are designed to be remappable across routing and transport contexts without modification. A component that communicates via in-memory routing within a single process may be transparently reconfigured to communicate via filesystem-based message exchange, or vice versa, without altering its internal logic. This enables gradual scaling, experimentation, and reuse without architectural fracture."

            "title": "Messages Over Mechanisms",
            "description": "FileTalk prioritizes stable message structure over fixed delivery mechanisms. By keeping the core message definition minimal and independent of infrastructure, FileTalk encourages systems where behavior emerges from message flow and external configuration rather than from tightly coupled runtime machinery."
