Patchboard Router:
* the status.json needs to tell whether it is live and running, or not;
  When you quit the program, it needs to update the status.json so that the "running" key is false,
  and when you start the program it needs to update the status.json so that the "running" key is true;
  And once every so many minutes, we should likely update the status.json.
* a "clear" command, that deletes all outgoing messages from the router;
* the program is leaving an outgoing shutdown message when it shuts down; it should be deleted after the final draining delivery
